# Build Service Adapters for the On-Demand Service Broker (ODB) in Golang
## Part of the On-Demand Services SDK

---

This project relies on the Pivotal Services SDK, available to customers and partners for download at [network.pivotal.io](http://network.pivotal.io)

## Usage 

Please use the SDK tag that matches the ODB release you are targeting.

For example if using ODB 0.15.1 release, use the [0.15.1 SDK tag](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/on-demand-services-sdk/tree/v0.15.1).
